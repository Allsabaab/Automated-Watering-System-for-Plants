This is a design of a system that uses an Arduino to intelligently control motors based on input from either an IR Remote or a Soil Moisture Sensor. Think of it as the brain behind a potential Robot or an Automated Watering System. In fact, this setup also functions as a remote-controlled Robot Car, allowing for manual field navigation to check soil moisture and precisely water specific areas. The LCD Screen provides real-time feedback, making the system interactive and informative.

This serves dual purposes:
  1. Monitors soil moisture levels and activates a water pump when necessary.
  2. Allows manual navigation using an IR remote to check soil conditions and water specific areas.​

Key Functionalities:
  1. The soil moisture sensor detects the moisture level, and the system activates the water pump when the soil is dry.
  2. Users can manually control the robot car using an IR remote to navigate and water specific areas.
  3. The LCD screen displays current system status, including soil moisture levels and operational modes.

The whole project was done in Autodesk TinkerCAD.
