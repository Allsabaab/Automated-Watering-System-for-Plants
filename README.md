This is a design of a system that uses an Arduino to intelligently control motors based on input from either an IR Remote or a Soil Moisture Sensor. Think of it as the brain behind a potential Robot or an Automated Watering System. In fact, this setup also functions as a remote-controlled Robot Car, allowing for manual field navigation to check soil moisture and precisely water specific areas. The LCD Screen provides real-time feedback, making the system interactive and informative.

The whole project was done in Autodesk TinkerCAD.
